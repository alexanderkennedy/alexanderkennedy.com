summary: An article about making an intention to change the world.

![Can this text be read?.](https://theselvedgeyard.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/bettie-page-whip-photo1.jpg)



I think I've exhausted the number people who's minds can be changed on Facebook. 

I don't mean changing minds over little things.

I mean big things; 

Like the idea that Syrian refugees are vulnerable human beings that ought to be greeted with compassion, empathy and support...Instead of fear, suspicion and xenophobia. 

If you disagree with this. It's likely that you don't read my posts anyway... that you're energy is focused towards articles about Abdullah steering the over-laden refugee boat before it capsized and his family drowned--  thereby making him a "human smuggler" and not a father who made a desperate gamble for the lives of his wife and children.

If, on the other hand, you agree that steering a ship does NOT necessarily make you a human smuggler... Then I believe I simply stating the obvious; I am effectively hitting you over the head with a cudgel.  

Or perhaps you are hitting me over the head with a cudgel.

Perhaps we are in a circle now. Like-minded people focused inwardly in the effort to convince each other of what we agree upon. 

It seems that it is a cathartic exercise for some sects of Islam and Christianity to self-flagellate in an open courtyard amongst their peers. 

I believe that what my friends--Largely athiests--- do on Facebook is no different than this practice. 

 I feel no urge to judge the practice... Except to say that the stated purpose of it is not happening.  

We are simply fixated inwards. With little effect on those who are outside.

In short, I find it funny that we expend so much of our energy on a social platform that makes no secret about segregating those of different mindsets.

(I've already chosen one theme for this post so I'll stay away from the obvious insinuations of cattle-herding.) 

So this is what I propose to do from now on:

1. On my Facebook post, I will state that there is an issue which needs to be addressed... And I will use a logical argument and evidence to explain why I believe that. 

2. I will attach an intention to my Facebook posts.

 Perhaps I will state that I will have  a face-to-face conversation.  Perhaps I will post information to an event that people might be interested in. 

Or... Since I "waste" enough time on Facebook... perhaps I could spend that same amount in my city doing something active... Like carrying a sign with a clear message. http://imgur.com/a/Rwj5B

Friends: 

With the upcoming election in mind;  there is a very good chance that the wool is being pulled over our eyes with our current inward-looking behaviour.

Strategist Lynton Crosby --recent addition to the Harper Campaign ---specializes in "sleeper" campaigns where the majority of people who care about equality and human rights are lulled into a false sense of confidence 

become convinced that they will win against those who gain power through race-baiting and fear-mongering...

--And then the rug is pulled out from under them because the votes have quietly been collected at the margins from those NOT on the rug.

Let's get off the rug.
