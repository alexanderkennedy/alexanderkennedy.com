# Alex' tutorial on Markdown

### Presented by Ashley at Launch Academy 

![Right now I'm trying to figure out how to collaborate with Ashely.](http://www.iconsulting.gr/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dream-sequel-collaborations.jpg)



This means saving my changes... and "pushing" to git hub repo (??) so that we can collaborate.


So after I made my changes. (Like changing the title to this post, and doing all this text) 

I need to click "save as"

THEN... I need to get in terminal, and make sure Jekyll is NOT running ( I press ctrl-c)

THEN...  I have to be in the ~/Coding/alexanderkennedy.com/directory before I run "git status"

This means that I get in terminal, and I do 'cd Coding/alex' and hit tab, then return.

Adn THEN I ...

1 type git status (and hit return)

Which shows the current changes.

(Apparenlty this will show the current changes.)

THEN, I go "git add" and hit return.

and THEN I do "git commit -m"  at which point I use qoutations marks and WRITE all the changes I made... Which includes changing the titlte, changing the text, and adding an inline image of shaking hands.

The final step is to to (git push) and then hit return.


Apparenlty teh next thing I need to do is make an inline image.
