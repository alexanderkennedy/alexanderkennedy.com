# CAN THIS BE READ on the website? (Alex's clean-up of the previous article he wrote.)




To all my comedian friends:

[Here is a picture of Nicole Arbour](http://www.fimho.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Nicole-Arbour.jpg), who made a lot of people angry with a dumb video that took cheap shots at "fat people".

She's struck a nerve, and the fallout has made comedians pull their hair out over the fact that she not only benefits from the views and clicks.... but that she milked the attention for all it's worth by disabling her account and claiming herself the victim of censorship.

The relevance of one tasteless hack in the discussion of body-shaming has been bled dry... Yet my comedian friends seem hell-bent on 'proving' that she's not a champion of free speech ....and gnashing their teeth on the bitter irony that she manufactured the very same controversy that idiots sympathize with her over.

However, unlike our Youtube friend Nicole Arbour, Kelly Block, Conservative MP for Saskatoon, will NOT benefit from the attention. 

Why? Because unlike Nicole Arbour... There's really no way to position yourself as the "victim" after your pamphlet gloats about ending unfair benefits for refugee claimants, right before a horrific international disaster.

Years ago, our sitting MP's would get a pat on the back and congratulations for their "tough stance" on foreigners. 

So... what do the faces of these dirty, freeloading, potential terrorist refugees look like?

Well, if you've followed the news, they look like drowned 3 year olds.

Now, as the pictures of floating children's corpses are splashed on our T.V. screens...Our self-congratulatory smirks are stuck on our faces. 

Youtube celebrity Nicole Arbour will benefit from the fallout of her mean-spritedness because there are plenty of dumbass white knights who will swallow her "victim-hood" hook line and sinker in the pathetic attempt to sleep with her.
(Which will further enrage my comedian friends so that they slam her and her money-making clickbait caravan rolls on ahead).

But racist assholes such as Kelly Block, Scott Reid and Paul Calandra will certainly NOT benefit from increased attention of their flyers. 

Women in Syria have had their jaws blown out...

 And yet the pamphlets they sent have loaded questions over whether  refugees should get "better" gold-plated dental benefits than "salt of the earth" Canadians.

Do you want take the wheels off Nicole Arbour's self serving cash-cow douchebag parade?

Well take away all the attention that benefits ONE creep who benefits from shilling prejudice and ignorance...

And instead focus it on A WHOLE BUNCH of creeps who want nothing more than to squirm and hide from their racist opportunism  that "seemed like a good idea at the time."








This means saving my changes... and "pushing" to git hub repo (??) so that we can collaborate.


So after I made my changes. (Like changing the title to this post, and doing all this text) 

I need to click "save as"

THEN... I need to get in terminal, and make sure Jekyll is NOT running ( I press ctrl-c)

THEN...  I have to be in the ~/Coding/alexanderkennedy.com/directory before I run "git status"

This means that I get in terminal, and I do 'cd Coding/alex' and hit tab, then return.

Adn THEN I ...

1 type git status (and hit return)

Which shows the current changes.

(Apparenlty this will show the current changes.)

THEN, I go "git add ." and hit return.

and THEN I do "git commit -m"  at which point I use qoutations marks and WRITE all the changes I made... Which includes changing the titlte, changing the text, and adding an inline image of shaking hands.

The final step is to to (git push) and then hit return.


Apparenlty teh next thing I need to do is make an inline image.
